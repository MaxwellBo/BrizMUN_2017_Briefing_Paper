#### Intro
Hey folks, I'm Max and I'm honoured to be one of your committee directors for BrizMUN 2017! I've been MUNing for about 4 years now, but this is my first time directing. Once upon a time, I studied International Relations, but now I'm currently in my 3rd year of Computer Science here at UQ. I spend my free time collecting mustard - I currenlty have 11 different varieties in my fridge, some flown in from Austria.

You'll probably be hearing from me again in the coming days regarding Slack and a couple of houskeeping issues, so keep your ears open. 

#### Slack

Hey folks! You should have all recieved your Slack invitations. If not, message me and I'll verify that it's been sent to the right email address.

If you're not familiar with Slack, it's an instant messaging app with features that'll Slack make it a lot easier to draft resolutions, create working groups, and pass notes. 

The setup process can occasionally be a bit of a pain, so it's easier if you login and set up your account before the conference starts, so we can move straight into debate.


TODO: Figure out if it's okay for delegates to start debating before the conference
Furthermore, we want to be able to able to see how you negotiate with other delegates and try to achieve your countries goals. So, whenever you want to negotiate or communicate with other delegates regarding commitee topics, create a channel with those delegates, Dermot, and myself, invited to it.

### Logistics


We recommend delegates bring a laptop for document processing and on-the-spot research, and a notepad and pen for note passing.

Powerboards and extension cables are ðŸ‘Œ, and anyone with spares should definitely bring them.
